# Machine Learning

## Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to my repository for the Machine Learning course I took in Fall '20. This repository is a collection of the machine learning projects I completed for the course.

Topics of projects in this repository include:
* [Alzheimer's Disease Prediction][alz]
  * Data Analysis & Processing
  * Medical Image Processing
* [Lung CT Scan Medical Image Processing][lung]
* [Seoul AirBnB Price Prediction][airbnb]
  * [Prediction Model][airbnbmodel]
  * [Presentation][ppt]
  * [Final Report][report]
  
For each project, I have experimented and learned about the following machine learning algorithms:
* [Alzheimer's Disease Prediction][alz]
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Decision Tree
  * Support Vector Machine
  * Random Forest
* [Lung CT Scan Medical Image Processing][lung]
  * Convolutional Neural Network
* [Seoul AirBnB Price Prediction][airbnb]
  * XGB Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
  * K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
  * Support Vector Regressor
  
All python scripts are uploaded with a link to Google Colab. Take a look!
